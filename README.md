## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 
**llamon3/llamon3** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a website migration
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use github. You could say it's about time.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am  minimially conversant (not being humble here, really minimal) in four languages, but fully conversant in English.
